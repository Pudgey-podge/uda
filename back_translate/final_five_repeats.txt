sardonic detective shane , thrown out of one town for bringing trouble , heads for home and his ex  partner ' s detective agency . the business is in a sad way , and shane , who has had the forethought to provide himself with a N  dollar commission from an old lady on the train , is welcomed with open arms . when pretty valerie purvis walks in the next day willing to pay over the odds to put a tail on the man who did her wrong , shane ' s way with the ladies looks like paying off yet again . but things start to go wrong when his partner is murdered , and shane himself comes home to find his apartment wrecked by a gentlemanly crook who comes back to apologise   and to tell him a fascinating fairy  story about the fabled horn of roland that looks like not being so mythical after all . miss purvis wants protection . the police want answers . and all sorts of people want the ' french horn ' . . . but shane is one jump ahead of everyone all the way . well , almost .
